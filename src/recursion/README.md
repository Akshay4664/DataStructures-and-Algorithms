Let's break down the time complexity and space complexity of the given code in a simple way:

Code Recap:
The code generates all subsequences of the input array using recursion. It includes or excludes each element at each index and prints the subsequences.

Time Complexity:
Number of Subsequences:

For an array of size n, there are 2^n possible subsequences.
This is because for each element, we can either:
Include it in the subsequence, or
Exclude it from the subsequence.
Thus, for n elements, we have 2^n different combinations (subsequences).
Operations Per Recursive Call:

In each recursive call, we either add an element to the list or remove it.
These operations take constant time O(1) (adding or removing an element at the end of the list).
Total Time Complexity:

Since there are 2^n possible subsequences and each subsequence requires constant time operations to be formed and printed, the total time complexity is:
𝑂
(
2
𝑛
)
O(2 
n
 )
where n is the size of the array.

Space Complexity:
Space for Result List:

The list result stores the current subsequence, which can have at most n elements (in the case of the full subsequence).
The space used by result is O(n) at any given time.
Recursive Call Stack:

Each recursive call adds a new entry to the call stack. The depth of the recursion is equal to n because we are making one recursive call for each element in the array.
In the worst case, the recursion depth will be n, meaning the call stack will take O(n) space.
Total Space Complexity:

The space required for the result list and the recursion call stack both contribute to the space complexity.
The total space complexity is:
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
+
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
=
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n)+O(n)=O(n)
(since the space used by the recursive call stack and the result list is proportional to n).

Summary:
Time Complexity:
O(2^n), because there are 2^n possible subsequences and each subsequence takes constant time to form and print.
Space Complexity:
O(n), because we need space for the result list (up to n elements) and the recursion call stack (up to n calls).
